title: Skypunch - Alpha Release
---

For a more technical background of the first draft, [read this](http://sawyerpaul.com/Skypunch-first-draft/). 

Since the summer, I've been working on a revised first draft of my new novel. It's complete, and I'm calling it an "Alpha Release," and making it available to a select few. Here's what that means: 

* I might start asking people to read it. 
* I might let you read it if you ask me. 
* I might post some excerpts on my blog/facebook/twitter, etc. 

If you're interested in reading the Revised first draft, let me know and I'll send it to you. Of course, I'd love to hear your input as you read it. This kind of stuff is really important to making a great book. 

This is slightly different than what I did last time. With my last book, A Record Year for Rainfall, the "beta" release was the stopping point. I wrote it, edited it myself, and released it, and you can still [read it for free](http://sawyerpaul.com/about/). I'm not going to do that with this book, because I want to try some new things, like: 

* Editing it properly, preferably with professionals
* Submitting it to agents & publishers
* Enjoyed by people who might not necessarily know me 
	
These are big goals, and I'm going to take the winter to work on them. Thanks so much for your support.
